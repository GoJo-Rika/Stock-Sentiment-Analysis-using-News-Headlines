# Stock Sentiment Analysis using News Headlines

## Description
This project demonstrates how to analyze stock sentiment using news headlines and machine learning. It guides you through collecting, preprocessing, and analyzing data to build a sentiment analysis model. The project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python.
## Key Features

### Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine the sentiment or emotion expressed in text. It classifies text into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. This is particularly useful in finance for understanding market sentiment based on news articles.

### NLTK
The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a powerful Python library used for working with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning.

## Usage

### Steps Followed
1. **Data Collection**: Gather news headlines related to stocks from various sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the headlines for analysis by removing punctuation, stopwords, and tokenizing.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Transform the textual data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
4. **Model Building**: Train a machine learning model to classify the sentiment of headlines as positive, negative, or neutral.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new headlines.
